Project Overview: Crime Structure Analysis in West Midlands (March 2022 - February 2023)

The primary objective of this project was to analyze the structure of crime in the West Midlands over a period of 12 months, spanning from March 2022 to February 2023. The analysis was conducted using official police data available from the UK Police Data website. The project aimed to uncover insights into the patterns and trends of criminal activities within the region during the specified timeframe.

Official police data was obtained from the UK Police Data website, and individual .csv files for each month were downloaded for the specified duration.
The downloaded .csv files were merged using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. This involved using SQL queries to combine the data sets into a unified database.
In order to enhance comprehension, certain records within the database were renamed for improved clarity and understanding.
Database: The culmination of the data processing activities resulted in the creation of a database containing a total of 265,754 records.

Upon establishing a server on the local machine, the database was transposed into Power BI for in-depth analysis and visualization.
Identified Insight: The most common crimes were in the Violence and Sexual Offences category. But here's the surprising part: over 95% of car-related crimes went unsolved and unpunished. This finding shines a light on a big reason behind the rampant car theft problem in the area.
